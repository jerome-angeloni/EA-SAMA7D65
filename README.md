# SAMA7D6 SoC and SiP Series
## Early Access Repository
The SAMA7D6 Series is a high-performance Arm® Cortex®-A7 CPU-based embedded microprocessor (MPU) targeting HMI and connectivity applications in the home/building, industrial, appliance & transportation markets.

The SAMA7D6 Series is delivered with a comprehensive development suite that includes a mainline Linux® distribution and the Microchip MPLAB® X/Harmony software framework.

Running at up to 1 GHz, the device offers support for multiple memories, such as 16-bit DDR2, DDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR2, LPDDR3, octal/quad SPI, and e.MMC Flash. It integrates various display interfaces, including MIPI DSI®, LVDS and 8-bit Serial RGB.

The SAMA7D6 Series features connectivity such as a dual 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC, an I3C controller, five CAN-FD and three high-speed USB interfaces

It also embeds advanced security functions, such as PUF, secure boot, secure key storage and high-performance crypto accelerators for AES, SHA, RSA and ECC.

Microchip provides an optimized power management solution for the SAMA7D65. The MCP16502 has been fully tested and optimized to provide the best power vs. performance for the SAMA7D65.
